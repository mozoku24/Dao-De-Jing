网上看到一个道德经的英译版：
Tao Te Ching - trans. by J.H.. McDonald
对照读了读，觉得很有趣，所以也自译了一版娱乐。
------------------------------------------------
执大象，The place where embodies the Tao
天下往，will attract everyone to come.
往而不害，Coming to the place will not be dangerous,
安平太，because the Tao is peaceful and tranquil.

乐与饵，In the taverns full of music and food,
过客止，a lot of people may stop travelling.

道之出口，Because people in the place of the Tao
淡乎其无味，talk boringly and stalely.
视之不足见，The view of the Tao is not magnificent.
听之不足闻，The sound of the Tao is not sweet.
用之不足既，The rule of the Tao can't provide details.
